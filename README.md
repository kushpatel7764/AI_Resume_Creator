**Why Google Gemini AI?**
* I chose this google gemini api because I am familiar with it
from my cloud computing class. 
* I find it easier to find documentation for most google products--in case additional help was need. 
* Gemini is also excellent at handling high quality text which is very important when building a good resume from 
text input. 

**AI Prompt**
* The AI prompt in the code is designed to generate a well-structured markdown resume. The prompt begins with "Remember my Personal Information" and "Remember the Job description".
This tells the AI model to retain both pieces of information before generating output.
