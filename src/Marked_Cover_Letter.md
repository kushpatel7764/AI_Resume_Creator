**Dear [Hiring Manager Name or Hiring Team],**

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Information Security Analyst/Sr. Information Security Analyst position at SERS, as advertised on [Platform where you saw the ad - e.g., company website].  Having closely reviewed the job description, I am confident that my skills and experience align perfectly with your requirements.

As a highly motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science major at Bridgewater State University (BSU), graduating in May 2025, I possess a strong foundation in [mention relevant coursework, e.g.,  computer networks, software engineering, and database systems]. My academic achievements, including a 4.0 major GPA and the prestigious Dr. Linda Wilkens and Dr. Glenn Pavlicek Scholarship, reflect my commitment to excellence and my dedication to the field of computer science.  Furthermore, my Google Software Development Certificate and I.T. Support Certificate demonstrate my practical skills and commitment to continuous learning.

My current projects further showcase my aptitude for information security. I am developing a bank statement processing application, which necessitates a strong understanding of data security and protection.  Additionally, my research internship at BSU involves creating a program that recognizes and converts tables from images to Excel format – a task requiring meticulous attention to detail and analytical abilities, critical for data loss prevention.  These projects have honed my problem-solving skills and my ability to think critically under pressure.

While my experience is primarily academic, I am eager to apply my knowledge and enthusiasm to a real-world setting.  I understand the importance of data loss prevention (DLP), fraud detection, and insider threat mitigation and I am eager to learn more about utilizing DLP technologies, including content inspection, data classification, and data encryption.  My proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, along with my experience with tools like Git and JetBrains IDEs, would allow me to quickly adapt to your existing systems and contribute effectively to your team.

I am particularly drawn to SERS's mission of providing retirement and healthcare benefits to Ohio's school employees.  The opportunity to contribute to such a vital organization while developing my expertise in information security is incredibly appealing.  I am a quick learner, possess excellent communication skills, and am confident in my ability to effectively convey complex technical information to non-technical stakeholders.

I am excited about the prospect of joining your team and contributing to SERS’s information security efforts.  Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

Kush Patel
